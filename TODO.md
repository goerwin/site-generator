# TODO
-   typescript support
    - install typescript
    - install @types too
    - tsc --init --jsx react
    - sourcemaps
-   tests
-   improve speed

# DONE
-   publicPath inside links in pages (dont actually need this, just <a href="/absolute/path">)
-   peerDependencies are removed after every `npm install` and they can't be installed either. This only affects dev (for now adding peer deps in devDeps too)
-   images
-   generate pages from pages folder
